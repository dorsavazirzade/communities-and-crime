# communities-and-crime

In this task, you will work with the Communities and Crime Dataset from the UCI repository (link). The objective is to analyze and model the data through the following steps:

## Data Preparation:

* Address missing values in the dataset by first filling them using the mean of each column and evaluate the suitability of this method.
* Propose and implement an alternative approach to handle missing data, explaining its advantages and analyzing its impact on performance.
* Submit the dataset with all missing values imputed.

## Linear Regression:

* Build a linear regression model on the prepared dataset.
* Perform 5-fold cross-validation with randomized 80-20 splits and report the average Mean Squared Error (MSE) across the test sets.
* Document the parameters obtained for each of the five models.
* 
## Ridge Regression:

* Apply Ridge regression using various values of the regularization parameter λ.
* Report the average test MSE across the splits for each λ, identifying the value that achieves the best fit.
* Visualize the results with a graph showing λ values on the x-axis and average MSE on the y-axis.
* Discuss how Ridge regression results could assist in feature selection.
## Feature Selection and Comparison:

* Train a model using a reduced set of features and compare its performance to the model trained on all features. Discuss the differences in their results.
## Exploration of Advanced Methods:

* Suggest advanced models or methods that could improve the dataset's performance. If applicable, provide the results of these methods.
